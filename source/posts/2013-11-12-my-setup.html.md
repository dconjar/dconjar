I'm a big fan of [The Setup][0], the popular blog showcasing the hardware and software people use to get things done.

I'm not famous enough yet to be considered for inclusion, so I interviewed myself. However, the interview with myself did not go well, so I wrote this fake interview instead.

This is actually not the most self-indulgent thing I've ever done.

Who are you, and what do you do?
--------------------------------

I'm Derek Conjar. I've been building websites since I was 11 years old. Or 12. Either way, I was a lesser human being.

I spend lots of time coding HTML, CSS, JavaScipt and Ruby. This website was built with a Ruby-based static site generator called Middleman. You can [insult my code on GitHub][1]. I've also worked with PHP and WordPress extensively, but I'm trying to move past that. Those were dark days.

What hardware do you use?
-------------------------

I own two MacBooks. One is a six-year-old white MacBook. I haven't used it in years and am too lazy to list it on eBay.

The other one is an early-2011 15" MacBook Pro with a 1680x1050 resolution, 16 GB of RAM and a Crucial m4 SSD. That thing **flies**. I can run several VMs at once with no lag. I love it more than my children.

I don't actually have children.

I also have two dual monitors that I don't use. I prefer to work without them because I can freely switch between sitting, standing and walking.

Yes, I said walking. This is my battlestation:

I don't own much physical stuff, and that includes hardware. I have an iPad but never charge it. I sold my Kindle a couple months after I bought it. I remembered that my iPhone can also function as a Kindle.

Oh, and I love my iPhone 4s! Almost forgot about that. People keep nagging me to give Android a whirl, but I'm happy with my iPhone.

And what software?
------------------

Most of my time is spent in Chrome, iTerm, and Sublime Text.

Yes, Sublime Text. I like vim in theory and use it a bit via ssh, but who has the patience to learn the hundreds of keybindings necessary to actually be productive with it? Maybe I'm not mature enough. Maybe I'll be a world-changing emacs user someday. We'll see.

If you have a Mac, you need [Alfred PowerPack][2]. Seriously. I use it to quickly retrieve files, launch applications, execute terminal commands, flush my DNS cache, view my clipboard history, and go to the bathroom. It does *everything*. Well, except the bathroom part.

If you have as many hundreds of online accounts as I, you need a password manager. [1Password][3] has never let me down. Most of my passwords are 25+ characters long and pseudo-random. However, the passwords that matter the most are [generated with dice][4].

Here are some other softwares that make life easier:

* **iTunes and Spotify** for getting in the zone
* **Photoshop** for manipulating graphics
* **Middleman** for compiling static websites
* **Ruby on Rails** for building web apps
* **jQuery** for making the DOM less painful
* **Gmail** for being really good without being too evil
* **GitHub** for being extremely useful in general

What would be your dream setup?
-------------------------------

I think we should bring mainframes back. Force me to learn some actual computer science.

I've been trying to figure out what to do with my living room. This is the answer!

What is your favorite quote from The Setup?
-------------------------------------------

Tom Preston-Werner, when he said:

> "My name is [Tom Preston-Werner][1]. I cofounded GitHub. I like tater tots and beer."

I couldn't agree with him more. He actually sent in another bio that The Setup rejected. [You can read that bio here][5].

Enough about me...
