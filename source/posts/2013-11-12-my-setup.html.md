I'm a big fan of [The Setup][0], the popular blog where well-known nerds get interviewed about the hardware and software they use to get stuff done.

I'm not famous enough yet to be considered for inclusion, so I interviewed myself. However, the interview with myself did not go well, so I wrote this fake interview instead.

This is actually not the most self-indulgent thing I've ever done.

Who are you, and what do you do?
--------------------------------

I'm Derek Conjar. I've been building websites since I was 11 years old. Or 12. Either way, I was a lesser human being.

I spend lots of time coding HTML, CSS, JavaScipt and Ruby. This website was built with a Ruby-based static site generator called Middleman. You can [insult my code on GitHub][1]. I've also worked with PHP and WordPress extensively, but I'm trying to move past that. Those were dark days.

What hardware do you use?
-------------------------

I own two MacBooks. One is a six-year-old white MacBook. I haven't used it in years and am too lazy to list it on eBay.

The other one is an early-2011 **15" MacBook Pro with a 1680x1050 resolution, 16 GB of RAM and a Crucial m4 SSD**. That thing *flies*. I can run several VMs at once with no lag. I love it more than my children.

I don't actually have children.

I own two dual monitors. I don't use them. **I prefer to work without them because I can freely switch between sitting, standing and walking**.

Yes, I said walking. This is my battlestation:

I don't own much physical stuff, and that includes hardware. I do own an iPad but never charge it. I sold my Kindle a couple months after I bought it, having remembered that my iPhone can also function as a Kindle.

Oh, and I love my iPhone 4s! Almost forgot about that. People keep nagging me to give Android a whirl, but I'm happy with my iPhone.

And what software?
------------------

**[Sublime Text][7] is my text editor of choice**. I like [vim][6] in theory and use it a bit via ssh, but who has the patience to learn the hundreds of keybindings necessary to actually be productive with it? Maybe I'm not mature enough. Maybe I'll be a world-changing emacs user someday. We'll see.

**[Chrome][8] is my go-to web browser**. The developer tools have saved my life more than a few times. And Chrome's vim emulator extension, **[Vimium][9]**, empowers you to surf the web without touching the mouse. No hands! Maybe I should learn more vim...

In speaking of keyboard shortcuts... **If you have a Mac, you need [Alfred PowerPack][2]**. Seriously. I use it to quickly retrieve files, launch applications, execute terminal commands, flush my DNS cache, view my clipboard history, and go to the bathroom. It does *everything* with just a few keystrokes. Well, except the bathroom part.

If you have as many hundreds of online accounts as I, you need a password manager. **[1Password][3] has never let me down**. It's got extensions for every browser and makes managing hundreds of long pseudo-random passwords effortless. It's awesome, but not quite as badass as [generating passwords with dice][4].

Here are some other softwares that help me get things done:

* **iTerm** for unix command line h4xing
* **iTunes and Spotify** for getting in the zone
* **Photoshop** for manipulating graphics
* **Twitter Bootstrap** for rapid prototyping
* **Middleman** for compiling static websites
* **Ruby on Rails** for building backend-heavy web apps
* **jQuery** for making the DOM less painful
* **Evernote** for clipping webpages for future reference
* **GitHub** for being extremely useful in general

What would be your dream setup?
-------------------------------

I think we should bring mainframes back. Force me to learn some actual computer science.

I've been trying to figure out what to do with my living room. I was considering building a laboratory, but a mainframe would be cooler.

That's enough about me and my setup. What's your setup?
