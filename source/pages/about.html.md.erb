My name is Derek Conjar. I’ve been building browser-based businesses since I was 12 years old.

I’m not joking. This site (derekconjar.com) has been around since 2001. It was once featured on CollegeHumor.com. “14 year old Derek Conjar shows you how to make money online.” I hope you didn’t take my advice back then.

After 13 years of working with websites and making mistakes, I’ve finally figured out what works. And what doesn’t work. Mostly through trial and error.

So many memories…

I remember the first time one of my websites was banned from Google. I was trying to get my site to the top of the search results. My strategy was to post links on “Free-For-All Links Pages.”

Have you ever seen a Free-For-All Links page? They were spammier than spam… Linking to thousands of Viagra and Rolex vendors. Pyramid schemes. Nigerian scammers. And my website.

Google didn’t take kindly to that.

I remember the first time one of my websites was hacked. The hacker replaced my homepage with Egyptian rap music. At least he was original.

When I got my first part-time web design job, I didn’t know CSS. CSS is the language that styles websites. It defines all the colors and font sizes and margins and stuff.

It’s pretty important for a working web designer to know CSS. So I learned quickly. No choice.

I learned JavaScript, PHP, SQL, Python, Regex, and various other languages the same way. Experience is a harsh but effective teacher. The best way to learn a foreign language is to become an inmate in a foreign jail. It works. Try it.

But there’s hope!

My journey wasn’t all sunshine and rainbows. There were countless hours of trial and error. It was rewarding. But it was also frustrating. Stressful. Overwhelming.

You don’t need to make the same mistakes.
